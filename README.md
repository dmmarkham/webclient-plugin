# VMware training offsite

	Session booked 09:00 - 14:00
	Help yourselves to free coffee and biscuits!

## Resources:
	Hands on Labs (new URL!) http://www.vmwlp.com/HOL 
		(if you find labs aren't loading, check they aren't using the old http://labs.hol.vmware.com/ domain)
	VMware blog, with recent entries listing of all the new labs (but the old URLS!): https://blogs.vmware.com/hol/

	VMworld 2017 session video sources are on YouTube, but not publicly listed! (so they don't show up in searches!)
		https://github.com/lamw/vmworld2017-session-urls/blob/master/vmworld-us-playback-urls.md
		https://github.com/lamw/vmworld2017-session-urls/blob/master/vmworld-eu-playback-uOnts them, older VMworld see archived here: http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Showcase/)

	Labs guides are available here https://docs.hol.vmware.com/ 
		(Useful for when you just want to read it through, rather than take the lab. 
		Also useful to scan to figure out whether a lab even has content you care about!)

	I also strongly recommend looking around https://code.vmware.com/ especially the forums
